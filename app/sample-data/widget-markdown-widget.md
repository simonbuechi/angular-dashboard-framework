# Fireboard

A dashboard built with Angular Dashboard Framework and Firebase. It shows data from json, markdown files and iframes, but does not serve as a data storage / aggregation. Simple charts using D3 and C3. 

## Purpose

As a quantified self user, I want all my key indicators und relevant data in one place, shown in a comprehensible way. This dashboard allows you to configure your data.
